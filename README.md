# FoneyCase-Phone-case-for-Samsung-S23

A neat sew-together phone case for a Samsung S23. Note: BOSL2 scad libraries are required. Made to replace my current case and as a test of the concept.

All skin layers should be printed using flexible filament. The stiffener plate layer should either be printed in normal filament or cut from material you have laying about. This includes metal if you want to protect your cards from RFID skimming and/or spare your goodies from radiation(?). This would be at the expense of phone signal when pocketed.   

All layers are sewn together using standard thread using the aligned holes provided. I recommend a back stitch (quicker) or a hand-sewn saddle stitch with lock-stitches (slower but better if thread breaks after heavy wear). This can all be unstitched for any later mods you wish to add. The card and cash wallets should be sewn at their single edge seam first before all layers are sewn together. I did not print out the phone holder, using it instead as a guide. I opted to use the holder from an old phone case I was replacing. A spread of dots of Gorilla Glue on the surface farthest from the centre (see re clasp, below) was the best adhesive I found for attaching the holder to the case.

Layer thickness can vary - I went with 0.75mm in the end. This produced 3 layers on my stock Ender-3 using a black Ninjaflex clone material. It seems pretty sturdy. 

The strap is intended to be used as a magnetic clasp with small embedded magnets. Note that the case directly under the phone holder is split into two plates. This is so the back can be folded and used as a phone wedge on a table.  A second case magnet can be placed internally and used with the strap to keep this form stable when used. Note that this only works if the phone holder is not glued to both plate sections behind it. 

The scad file is included. Global variables are used as much as possible, should people want to customise for another phone. Due to slightly scrappy code, some ultra-fine tuning in the modules may still be needed if drastic alterations are made.

Footnote: I originally intended to print the layers over a bed lined with leather to get the faux leather impression on the surfaces - hence 'foney'. Whilst I think this may have worked, I actually quite liked the printmarks so I did not pursue this. I also planned to use the flexible filament itself as the thread, since pulling a piece extends it to a stable thinner form about 1/4 the thickness without stretching further. I did not pursue this either, as I was low on filament and arguably, it is a bit wasteful.
